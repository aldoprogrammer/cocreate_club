## 4. NFT-Based Access Flow

### ðŸ§¾ Creator Launches a Campaign

- Deploys NFT contract for each tier  
  â†’ stored in `campaign_tiers.nft_contract_address`
- Sets staking requirements via `staking_amount`

### ðŸ’³ Fan Stakes Tokens â†’ Mints NFT

- When a fan stakes:
  - `user_stakes.nft_minted = true`
  - `user_stakes.nft_token_id` is stored

### ðŸ”“ Unlocking Perks via NFT Ownership

| Action               | Requirement                              |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| View premium updates | Has matching tier NFT (`user_stakes`)     |
| Join top-tier calls  | Owns `super_duper_fan` NFT                |
| Access voting        | Verified by NFT ownership                 |

### âœ… Check If User Has NFT Access

```sql
SELECT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM user_stakes us
  JOIN campaign_tiers ct ON us.tier_id = ct.id
  WHERE us.user_id = 'user-uuid-here'
    AND us.campaign_id = 'campaign-uuid-here'
    AND us.nft_minted = true
    AND ct.tier = 'super_duper_fan'::badge_tier
) AS has_access;

ðŸŽ¯ Get All Active Campaigns
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM campaigns 
WHERE status = 'active';
ðŸ§¾ List Userâ€™s NFT Badges
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT ct.tier, ct.title, us.nft_token_id 
FROM user_stakes us

6. Deployment Notes
Prerequisites
âœ” Supabase Project (with Row-Level Security enabled)

âœ” Etherlink RPC (for NFT deployment)

âœ” thirdweb SDK for minting logic

Setup Steps
Deploy schema using Supabase SQL Editor.

Add RLS policies to match the documented access rules.

Integrate thirdweb SDK to:

Deploy tiered NFT contracts

Mint NFTs on user staking

Track contract address and token IDs in the DB

Use user_stakes.nft_minted and nft_token_id to unlock campaign features.
